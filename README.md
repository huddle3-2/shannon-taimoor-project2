# shannon-taimoor-project2

A pair programming application created using HTML, SCSS, JavaScript, and PokeAPI.

The application fetches a randomized number of Pokemon depending on the difficulty rating the user selects, and generates the images hidden under Pokeball images.
The user has to click on each Pokeball and find a match in the lowest number of moves to match 'em all!
